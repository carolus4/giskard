Overall - should test moving to 0 temperature here (from 0.1)\n- Gemma had 1 instance of hanging. But in fairness that\u2019s happened to ollama too. When evaluating a small sample like this, it probably makes sense to avoid outliers. Excluding outliers, gemma was ~20% faster, as expected from slower weights.\n\nInterestingly, release (and recategorisations) led to gemma over-enthusiastically categorizing tasks (e.g. this one) across all goals.
