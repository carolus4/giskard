It\u2019s fantastic that you\u2019re looking for a quick win \u2013 that\u2019s exactly the right approach when you\u2019re short on time.\n\nIt looks like we tried to add \u201cReview Interview Questions\u201d to your to-do list, but it\u2019s already there. That\u2019s a good reminder that we\u2019re building a comprehensive plan, but it also means we need to be really mindful about avoiding duplicates.\n\nSince we\u2019ve already identified that task, let\u2019s shift our focus to finding something *immediately* actionable within those 20 minutes. Instead of tackling a large task, let\u2019s go smaller.\n\n**Here\u2019s what I suggest:**\n\n1. **Quick Brain Dump (5 minutes):** Just jot down *every* single thing that comes to mind about the interview. Don\u2019t worry about organizing it yet \u2013 just get it all out of your head. This will clear your mental space.\n\n2. **Prioritize 3 Key Points (10 minutes):** Looking at your brain dump, pick the *three* most important things you need to remember about the interview. These could be key skills, company values, or something you want to highlight. Write those down clearly.\n\n3. **One Small Action (5 minutes):**  Based on those three key points, do *one* small thing to solidify them. Maybe it\u2019s writing down a quick example of how you\u2019ve demonstrated that skill, or researching a key company value.\n\n\n\n**Why this works:** It\u2019s a realistic approach for a short burst of time.  You\u2019ll feel a real sense of accomplishment after completing these steps, and you'll have a clearer focus for your next interview prep session.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about getting everything perfect \u2013 just aim for a small, productive win!\n\nWould you like me to help you create a new task based on this quick review, or would you prefer to tackle one of these steps now?", "side_effects_count": 1, "side_effects": [{"success": false, "error": "Task \"Review Interview Questions\" already exists", "action": "create_task", "existing_task_id": 118}]}

Start by reviewing the documentation: [https://docs.mcp-agent.com/cloud/overview](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/cloud/overview) \u2013 it looks like a key area for growth.\n*   **\u201cWrite up some \u2018I wish this worked\u2019\u201d (ID: 117):** This is a fantastic opportunity for reflection.  The fact that you\u2019re documenting a failed query suggests a potential gap in your understanding or a usability issue.  Spend some time dissecting *why* the query didn\u2019t work and what you\u2019d ideally want to see happen. This could lead to a valuable bug report or a suggestion for improvement.\n\n**Medium Priority - Worth Investigating Soon:**\n\n*   **\u201cCheck out MCP-agent cloud\u201d (ID: 117):**  (Duplicate - worth revisiting)\n*   **\u201cReview interview questions\u201d (ID: 118):** Given your upcoming interview prep, revisiting your prepared questions is a smart move. It's a quick way to refresh your knowledge and confidence.\n\n**Other Tasks \u2013 Consider Later:**\n\n*   **\u201cWrite up some \u2018I wish this worked\u2019\u201d (ID: 117):** (Duplicate - revisit when you have time)\n*   **\u201cReview interview questions\u201d (ID: 118):**\n\n**To help you prioritize even further, could you tell me:**\n\n*   **What is the context of these tasks?** (e.g., are you working on a specific project, preparing for a role, or just generally trying to learn new things?)\n*   **What\u2019s your biggest learning goal right now?** (e.g., improve your agent development skills, prepare for an interview, or learn about a specific technology?)", "side_effects_count": 1, "side_effects": [{"success": true, "action": "get_tasks", "tasks": [{"id": 17, "title": "Shopify - Skip the line", "description": "https://www.shopify.com/careers/extraordinary\\nhttps://www.shopify.com/careers/product-management_a69fc195-de20-42f5-868d-2cf7d7182836\\n\\n---\\nYou have no off switch.

Spending just 30 minutes reviewing your prepared questions will significantly boost your confidence.\n*   **\u201cCheck out MCP-agent cloud\u201d (ID: 117):**  This seems like a potentially valuable learning opportunity, especially given you're exploring agent capabilities.  Take some time to familiarize yourself with the documentation \u2013 it could inform your agent development efforts.\n\n**Medium Priority - Worth Investigating:**\n\n*   **\u201cWrite up some \u2018I wish this worked\u2019\u201d (ID: 118):** This is a really insightful task. The fact that the agent struggled to suggest a small win highlights a potential area for improvement in your agent\u2019s ability to understand user needs and offer relevant suggestions.  Analyze the agent\u2019s response \u2013 what was the user\u2019s original request? \u2013 and use that to refine the agent\u2019s training data.\n*   **\u201cReview interview questions\u201d (ID: 118):**  This is your top priority given the upcoming interview.\n\n**Longer-Term - Explore as Time Allows:**\n\n*   **\u201cCheck out MCP-agent cloud\u201d (ID: 117):**  This seems like a good investment of time, but it\u2019s lower priority than the immediate interview prep.\n\nTo help me narrow things down further and give you even more targeted advice, could you tell me:\n\n1.  **What kind of learning are you most interested in?** (e.g., agent development, interview skills, specific technologies?)\n2.  **What\u2019s your timeline for the interview?** (Knowing how much time you have will help me prioritize.)", "side_effects_count": 1, "side_effects": [{"success": true, "action": "get_tasks", "tasks": [{"id": 17, "title": "Shopify - Skip the line", "description": "https://www.shopify.com/careers/extraordinary\\nhttps://www.shopify.com/careers/product-management_a69fc195-de20-42f5-868d-2cf7d7182836\\n\\n---\\nYou have no off switch.

Instead of trying to add something new, let's really *dig into* the existing task.\n\nHere\u2019s what I suggest:\n\n1. **Quick Scan & Prioritization:** Spend 5-7 minutes simply reviewing the interview questions. Don't try to answer them all deeply. Just quickly read through them and mark the ones you feel least confident about \u2013 maybe with a \u2018?\u2019 or a quick note.\n\n2. **Targeted Research (10-10 mins):** Based on those \u201c?\u201d questions, quickly search for 1-2 key points related to them. Use a tool like Google or your notes to get a quick refresher. The goal is to boost your confidence on those specific areas.\n\n3. **Quick Reflection (3-5 mins):** Before you finish, jot down one thing you learned or one way you could better answer a particular question. This small action can really make you feel like you\u2019ve made progress.\n\n**Don\u2019t worry about feeling like you haven\u2019t \u201cdone\u201d anything huge. Small, focused bursts of activity are *exactly* what you need when you have limited time.**\n\nTo help me understand your interview prep even better, could you tell me:\n\n*   What kind of interview is this for (e.g., job interview, performance review)?\n*   Are there any specific areas you feel particularly nervous about?", "side_effects_count": 1, "side_effects": [{"success": false, "error": "Task \"Review interview questions\" already exists", "action": "create_task", "existing_task_id": 118}]}

You have quite a few that could be really valuable for your development! Here\u2019s a categorized look at what you\u2019re working on, with some recommendations for next steps:\n\n**1. Agent & Tool Exploration (High Priority):**\n\n*   **Task ID: 117 - \u201cWrite up some \u2018I wish this worked\u2019\u201d:** This is *crucial*. The fact that the agent struggled to provide a helpful task suggestion when you needed a quick win highlights a key area for improvement.  **Action:** Spend some time analyzing *why* the agent failed.  What specific criteria were you using when you asked for a task?  Documenting this will help you refine your prompts and improve the agent\u2019s responses.\n*   **Task ID: 118 - \u201cReview interview questions\u201d:**  This is directly related to your career goals.  Make sure you're fully prepared for your interview prep.\n\n**2. Agent & Tool Exploration (Medium Priority):**\n\n*   **Task ID: 114 - \u201cNew app idea - Beli for movies\u201d:** This is a creative thought, and it's great you're brainstorming! However, it's currently just an idea.  **Action:**  If you're serious about this, start with some basic research: What are the existing movie apps like? What features would make yours stand out?\n*   **Task ID: 115 - \u201cCheck out MCP-agent cloud\u201d:**  The MCP-agent cloud is a potentially powerful tool.  **Action:**  Take some time to explore the documentation ([https://docs.mcp-agent.com/cloud/overview](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/cloud/overview)) to understand its capabilities and how it might integrate with your other projects.\n\n**3. General Learning & Reflection:**\n\n*   **Task ID: 117 - \u201cReview interview questions\u201d:** As mentioned above, this is vital for your career.\n*   **Task ID: 118 - \u201cWrite up some \u2018I wish this worked\u2019\u201d:**  As mentioned above, this is vital for your career.\n\nTo help me give you even more targeted advice, could you tell me:\n\n*   What are your primary learning goals right now (e.g., improving your coding skills, exploring new tools, preparing for a specific career goal)?\n*   Are there any specific areas you'd like to focus on within the learning tasks listed above?", "side_effects_count": 1, "side_effects": [{"success": true, "action": "get_tasks", "tasks": [{"id": 17, "title": "Shopify - Skip the line", "description": "https://www.shopify.com/careers/extraordinary\\nhttps://www.shopify.com/careers/product-management_a69fc195-de20-42f5-868d-2cf7d7182836\\n\\n---\\nYou have no off switch.

It looks like you already have a task titled \"Review Interview Questions\" in your system \u2013 great, that\u2019s a really important one to keep track of.\n\nSince you only have 20 minutes and were looking for a quick win, let\u2019s shift our focus. Instead of tackling the big \u201cReview Interview Questions\u201d right now, how about we spend those 20 minutes on something smaller and more immediate?\n\n**Here\u2019s what I suggest:**\n\n1. **Quick Brain Dump (5 mins):** Just jot down *everything* that\u2019s swirling around in your head related to the interview. Don\u2019t worry about organizing it, just get it out \u2013 anxieties, things you want to remember to say, skills you want to highlight. This will help clear your mind.\n\n2. **Refine One Key Skill (10 mins):** From that brain dump, pick *one* skill or experience you want to confidently emphasize during the interview. Spend 10 minutes writing down 3-5 specific examples where you demonstrated that skill.  Focus on results \u2013 what did you achieve?\n\n3. **Positive Affirmation (5 mins):** End on a positive note! Write down one thing you\u2019re good at and one thing you\u2019re excited about in this interview opportunity.\n\nThis approach gives you a sense of accomplishment quickly, while still building momentum for your bigger task.\n\nWould you like me to help you create a new task for \u201cReview Interview Questions\u201d now, or would you prefer to focus on this smaller, more immediate win?

If you have relevant experience, great. If not, also great because I am always curious about how things run in other organizations of different sizes.\\n\\nThat\u2019s an interesting perspective! I wrote some ideas here in case that helps us get to interesting areas more quickly.\\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dhl9HcVFEPP212HU-HkAEtQeJMQ26XN-U1_y2AiGbng/edit?usp=sharing\\nOne thing I\u2019m doing at the moment is attempting to condense my perspectives into write-ups that I can feel more confident about. This is only an early set of notes, but it might become a post later. If you have any suggestions on what\u2019s interesting or unclear about the topic in general that\u2019s cool for me to hear \\n\\n> Thanks for sharing this note. Almost everything seemed relevant to me, particularly the soap box. I'm trying to find a better way to communicate with developers. Challenges that I identified are the lack of high level vision and lack of transparency about what customers are saying from developers' perspectives. It's a bit complicated in my case because all customers for the current project are Japanese and all developers are in Europe. I need to deal with language barrier and time differences.\\nI'd love to pick your brain on this more tomorrow.\\n\\n\u2014 \\nNotes: Chat was nice. Mai liked the soapbox idea.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of what\u2019s catching my eye, grouped a bit to make it easier to digest:\n\n**1. Giskard - Core Development & Experimentation:**\n\n*   There's a significant chunk of work focused on the \u201cGiskard\u201d project \u2013 that\u2019s your main todo list app. You've got tasks around moving metrics, refining the user experience, and even a cool idea for a \"Beli\" app for movie recommendations!\n*   Several tasks are related to investigating and troubleshooting issues with the backend, specifically around querying data. It seems like you're really digging into the technical details.\n*   You\u2019re also experimenting with different agent capabilities, like testing the expanded agent \u2013 that\u2019s a smart way to see what's possible.\n\n**2. Learning & Research:**\n\n*   You're actively researching external tools and resources \u2013 you've got a link to the MCP-agent cloud, and you\u2019re looking into moving tasks out of a backlog.  This shows a desire to learn and incorporate best practices.\n\n**3. Task Management & Prioritization:**\n\n*   A lot of the tasks revolve around refining your workflow and how you're managing your priorities. You're thinking about how to move metrics, and how to structure your tasks for maximum impact.\n\n\n\n**Overall, it seems like you're in a really thoughtful, iterative phase of development.**  It's fantastic that you\u2019re not just building, but also constantly evaluating and experimenting. \n\nTo help me understand what you're trying to achieve and potentially offer more targeted assistance, could you tell me:\n\n*   **What's the biggest challenge you're currently facing with the \u201cGiskard\u201d project?** (Is it a specific feature, a technical hurdle, or something else?)\n*   **Which of these tasks feels most urgent to you right now?**", "side_effects_count": 1, "side_effects": [{"success": true, "action": "get_tasks", "tasks": [{"id": 17, "title": "Shopify - Skip the line", "description": "https://www.shopify.com/careers/extraordinary\\nhttps://www.shopify.com/careers/product-management_a69fc195-de20-42f5-868d-2cf7d7182836\\n\\n---\\nYou have no off switch.

It seems like you're working on a really interesting project \u2013 \u201cGiskard.\u201d I\u2019ve pulled up all the open tasks, and it looks like there's a lot of great potential here.\n\nRight now, there are 23 open tasks, and it seems like you\u2019re tackling a few key areas. Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n*   **Bug Fixes & Refinements:** There are a couple of urgent issues \u2013 specifically a hanging query back-end and a need to refine the \u201cundo\u201d feature so it only appears when it's actually relevant. These are definitely high priorities.\n*   **Feature Development:** You\u2019re exploring ideas like moving tasks out of a backlog, grouping tasks together, and potentially adding a way to link tasks \u2013 all things that would make the tool much more powerful.\n*   **Learning & Exploration:** You're also diving into some exciting learning areas! You're investigating the MCP-agent cloud, thinking about a new app idea for movies (Beli!), and even considering how to share your project with others \u2013 which is great for getting feedback and potentially building a community.\n\nI noticed a few things that might be helpful to focus on. The hanging query back-end is a real pain point, so getting that resolved should be your first step. Also, that \"undo\" feature \u2013 it\u2019s currently too broad, so let\u2019s narrow down when it\u2019s actually useful.\n\nIt looks like you\u2019ve got a really ambitious vision for Giskard!

It seems like getting this stable is a priority.\n*   **User Experience Tweaks:** You're actively working on improving the user experience. Task ID 76 highlights a recent Ollama hang issue, and there\u2019s a task (ID 113) to explore a new idea - Beli for movies.\n*   **Feature Refinement:** You're refining existing features. Task ID 115 is about checking out MCP-agent cloud, and task ID 119 is about fixing the \"undo\" feature to only appear when relevant. \n\n**Some Interesting Ideas & Research:**\n\n*   **Agent Learning:** You're exploring the potential of using MCP-agent cloud (task ID 115), which could be a really valuable avenue to explore for future development.\n*   **User Feedback & Engagement:** The focus on user experience and the recent Ollama hang (task ID 76) indicates you're paying close attention to user feedback and how to ensure a smooth experience.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nIt seems like you're tackling a mix of critical technical issues, user experience enhancements, and exploring new technologies.  It\u2019s great to see this level of detail and proactive problem-solving! \n\nWould you like me to:\n\n*   Drill down into a specific task in more detail?\n*   Help you prioritize these tasks based on their impact?\n*   Perhaps brainstorm some solutions for the back-end issues?", "side_effects_count": 1, "side_effects": [{"success": true, "action": "get_tasks", "tasks": [{"id": 17, "title": "Shopify - Skip the line", "description": "https://www.shopify.com/careers/extraordinary\\nhttps://www.shopify.com/careers/product-management_a69fc195-de20-42f5-868d-2cf7d7182836\\n\\n---\\nYou have no off switch.
