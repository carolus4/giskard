I was very NOT sharp, partly bc I was tired.\n\nthe main things to work on:\n1. Keep practising answer techniques. Use yoodli to be less fluffy. Give chapter headings. \n2. Make a plan, write it down. Take 2mn at the start to outline beat.s\n3. Write items in a list - especially if I’m going to use the list. Be careful of getting lost in list item 1 and then never going to 2." categories:career

x 2025-09-22 project:Networking Coffee with Mai note:"## Context from Slack\n> I would love to hear your experience with creating boundaries/mutual understanding of what your role as a PM is. I'm also curious about road mapping practice within an organization that is not familiar with having a PM. My current company is small (25-30 ppl), start-up (founded in 2020) and remote (~50% work from Europe) so these aspects probably contribute to the difficulty in communicating and clarifying things. If you have relevant experience, great. If not, also great because I am always curious about how things run in other organizations of different sizes.\n\nThat’s an interesting perspective! I wrote some ideas here in case that helps us get to interesting areas more quickly.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dhl9HcVFEPP212HU-HkAEtQeJMQ26XN-U1_y2AiGbng/edit?usp=sharing\nOne thing I’m doing at the moment is attempting to condense my perspectives into write-ups that I can feel more confident about. This is only an early set of notes, but it might become a post later. If you have any suggestions on what’s interesting or unclear about the topic in general that’s cool for me to hear \n\n> Thanks for sharing this note. Almost everything seemed relevant to me, particularly the soap box. I'm trying to find a better way to communicate with developers. Challenges that I identified are the lack of high level vision and lack of transparency about what customers are saying from developers' perspectives. It's a bit complicated in my case because all customers for the current project are Japanese and all developers are in Europe. I need to deal with language barrier and time differences.\nI'd love to pick your brain on this more tomorrow.\n\n— \nNotes: Chat was nice. Mai liked the soapbox idea. Was good for me to get confirmation my experience was valuable."

Overall - should test moving to 0 temperature here (from 0.1)\n- Gemma had 1 instance of hanging. But in fairness that’s happened to ollama too. When evaluating a small sample like this, it probably makes sense to avoid outliers.
