# 🗑️ **Delete Task Feature Added!**

## ✨ **What's New**

You can now **permanently delete tasks** from your todo list! This gives you complete control over your task management.

## 🎯 **How to Delete Tasks**

### **Method 1: Task Detail Modal**
1. **Click on any task** to open the detail modal
2. **Click the red "Delete" button** (🗑️ trash icon)
3. **Confirm deletion** in the confirmation dialog
4. **Task is permanently removed** from your todo.txt file

### **Method 2: Confirmation Dialog**
- **Clear warning**: *"Are you sure you want to delete '[Task Title]'? This action cannot be undone."*
- **Click "OK"** to confirm deletion
- **Click "Cancel"** to keep the task

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend (Flask API)**
- **New endpoint**: `DELETE /api/tasks/{file_idx}/delete`
- **Removes task permanently** from todo.txt
- **Returns success message** with deleted task title

### **Frontend (JavaScript)**
- **New delete button** in task detail modal
- **Confirmation dialog** prevents accidental deletions
- **Success notification** confirms deletion
- **Automatic refresh** updates the UI

### **Database (todo.txt)**
- **Task completely removed** from file
- **No trace left** in the system
- **File indices preserved** for other tasks

## 🎨 **UI/UX Features**

### **Delete Button Styling**
- **Red background** (`#dc3545`) for clear danger indication
- **Trash icon** (🗑️) for universal recognition
- **Hover effects** with scale animation
- **Positioned left** of Save button for logical flow

### **Confirmation Dialog**
- **Task title shown** in confirmation message
- **Clear warning** about permanent deletion
- **Standard browser confirm()** for consistency

### **Success Feedback**
- **Green notification**: *"Task deleted!"*
- **UI automatically refreshes** to show updated task list

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Permanent Deletion**
- **Cannot be undone** - once deleted, the task is gone forever
- **No recycle bin** or trash folder
- **Confirmation required** to prevent accidents

- **Other tasks unaffected** by deletion
- **File indices maintained** for remaining tasks
