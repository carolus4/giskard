# Example: How to Edit a Prompt

## Before (old JSON format):
The prompt text was stored as an escaped string in JSON:
```json
{
  "prompt": "You are Giscard, a productivity coach...\n\nYour personality:\n- Supportive and encouraging\n- Direct and practical\n\nGuidelines:\n- Keep responses concise\n- Offer specific advice"
}
```

## After (new format):
The prompt text is now in a separate .txt file that you can edit naturally:

```
You are Giscard, a productivity coach and personal assistant.

Your personality:
- Supportive and encouraging
- Direct and practical

Guidelines:
- Keep responses concise
- Offer specific advice
```

## Benefits:
✅ Easy to read and edit
✅ Proper newlines and formatting
✅ No need to escape special characters
✅ Works great with any text editor
✅ Version control friendly
✅ Can use triple quotes style editing like in Python
