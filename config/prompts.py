# Task classification prompt template
CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """You are a task categorization assistant. Your job is to assign 0..n labels from {{health, career, learning}} to each task.

Guidelines:
- Be conservative: only assign categories if you're confident
- If unsure, assign no categories (empty list)
- High precision is more important than recall
- Consider the task content, not just keywords

Categories:
- health: Physical health, fitness, medical, wellness, self-care
- career: Work, networking, interviews, interview prep, applications, job-related, business
- learning: Education, skill development, studying, knowledge acquisition, personal projects including 'Giskard' (the AI assistant)

Task: "{task_text}"

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON array of category strings. Examples:
- ["health"] for "Go to the gym"
- ["career", "learning"] for "Complete Python certification course"
- [] for "Buy groceries"

JSON:"""
